# Windows10-Login-Screen-HTML
A PHP/HTML clone of the Windows 10 Login screen that can accept querystrings to dynamically customize the page.
Useful for penetration testing, particularly when using physical keyboard implants such as the Rubbery Ducky as it can be made full screen on an locked machine, potentially capturing login credentials.
